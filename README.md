# nagios-plugins

In this repo, we share some useful plugins for Nagios.

## Check 389dir (Fedora directory server) replication 

This script is forked from the original documentation site, which is pretty obsolete. This is our version we use for monitoring our servers.

## Check Galera cluster status

Very simple bash script, which parses two attributes from galera-status and makes a simple decision whether the cluster is healthy.
